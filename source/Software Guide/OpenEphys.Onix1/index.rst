Bonsai
========================

`Bonsai <https://bonsai-rx.org/>`__ is a visual programming language (think
LabView) for `reactive programming
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming>`__. Its simple looks are
deceiving. Bonsai is a very advanced piece of software with features such as 

- Real-time compilation of workflows to machine code as they are edited
  (zero-overhead).
- A large array of operators for combining and sychronizing asynchronous data
  streams, which is a major issue in other software.
- Lots of support for all sorts of hardware outside of ONIX.

Bonsai is ideal for accessing the full power of ONIX hardware and combining it
with third-party data sources (e.g. machine visiion cameras,
behavioral hardware, etc.), and for real-time processing and manipulation of
data streams.  `OpenEphys.Onix1
<https://open-ephys.github.io/onix1-bonsai-docs/index.html>`__ is a Bonsai
library for ONIX hardware. This library contains `Bonsai Operators
<https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/operators.html>`__ for acquiring and
sending data to ONIX hardware.
