Setup
#########################

- Connect the headstages either directly to host or through the breakout board (see :ref:`headstage_link`).

- The LED on the breakout board (and the PCIe board itself, if visible) should turn purple when the link is made between the headstage and the PCIe host board.

- If you are using the deprecated Bonsai.Onix Bonsai package, double-clicking on the OniContext node in Bonsai should now show an additional tab, labelled with the type of headstage.
