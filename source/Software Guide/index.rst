    Bonsai.ONIX (DEPRECATED) <Bonsai.ONIX/index>

:ref:`Bonsai <openephys_onix1ref>`
    A `Bonsai <https://bonsai-rx.org/>`__ library for acquiring data from ONIX
    hardware for real-time experiments. Bonsai is very good at processing the
    heterogeneous data streams produced by ONIX hardware.

:ref:`Open Ephys GUI <open_ephys_gui>`
    The Open Ephys GUI can be used for ONIX data visualization.

:ref:`oni-repl <oni_repl>`
    A simple command-line application that can be used for debugging and basic
    streaming IO with ONIX hardware.

.. tip:: ONIX uses an `ONI-compliant API
   <https://open-ephys.github.io/ONI/api/index.html>`__ that is software
   agnostic. If you want to use ONIX hardware with your acquisition software,
   please :ref:`get in touch <support>`.
