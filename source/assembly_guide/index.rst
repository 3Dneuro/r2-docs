Assembly Guide
==============

Here, you will find two levels of assembly instructions:

1. Instructions on **how to assemble the products**, when applicable. 

For the most part, 3Dneuro/Open Ephys ship fully assembled products. Microdrives, microrails and holders are fully assembled. Only the rat/mouse caps are partially assembled. For the rat/mouse cap, final assembly involves simple manual steps such fastening some screws, cutting with scissors, applying glue and some soldering. The use of soldering is required only if you follow the `Vöröslakos et al. <https://elifesciences.org/articles/65859>`__ approach, or similar, to manage probe connectors. 


2. Links to instructions for **assembling the designs from parts**. 

This assumes that you source all the parts yourself, and that you have the necessary tools. The most detailed information about how to assemble the R2 system components is found in the `methods paper <https://elifesciences.org/articles/65859>`__, so read it first to familiarize yourself with how the system works, and which decisions you will have to make while building the tools.
