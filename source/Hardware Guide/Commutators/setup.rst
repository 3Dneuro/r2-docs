Setup
#########################

The active commutator should be placed above the behavioural setup, such that the animal can travel the full length of the arena. Bonsai communicates with the commutator through a USB cable, which also powers the device.

1. Mount the active commutator above the setup (you can use the same frame as the base stations, with the commutator in the middle).

2. Connect the commutator to the computer using a USB to micro-USB cable

3. If the commutator makes too much noise while turning, apply plastic-safe grease to the 3D-printed gears reduce noise.
